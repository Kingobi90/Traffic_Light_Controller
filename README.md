# Traffic_Light_Controller
We've developed a sensor-driven traffic light controller using VHDL. Our goal was to reduce congestion by adjusting the duration of  green lights  based on real-time traffic flow. Our design prioritizes high-traffic roads while minimizing delays at rarely used junctions. This idea was conceived while sitting in traffic :)

# Sensor-Driven Traffic Light Controller (VHDL)

- Designed and Implemented a sensor-driven traffic light controller using VHDL to reduce congestion and optimize real-time traffic flow.  
- Dynamically adjusts green light durations based on actual road usage detected by sensors.  
- Prioritizes high-traffic roads to keep vehicles moving efficiently.  
- Allows emergency vehicles to bypass congestion, improving response times.  
- Minimizes unnecessary delays at rarely used junctions with sensor-based activation.

# Sensor-Driven Traffic Light Controller (VHDL)

- Designed and implemented a **sensor-driven traffic light controller** using **VHDL**, optimizing real-time traffic flow and reducing congestion.  
- **Adaptive timing:** Dynamically adjusts green light durations based on sensor-detected road usage.  
- **Priority-based control:** Allocates longer green phases to high-traffic roads for smoother traffic movement.  
- **Emergency vehicle override:** Enables immediate green signals for emergency vehicles, enhancing response times.  
- **Smart activation:** Minimizes delays at low-traffic junctions by switching lights **only when necessary**.

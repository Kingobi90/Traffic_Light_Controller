We've developed a sensor-driven traffic light controller using VHDL to reduce congestion and prioritize real-time traffic flow. Unlike traditional systems with fixed timers, our design dynamically adjusts green light durations based on actual road usage detected by sensors.

--> Prioritizes high-traffic roads to keep vehicles moving efficiently.

--> Allows emergency vehicles to bypass congestion, improving response times.

--> Minimizes unnecessary delays at rarely used junctions with sensor-based activation.
